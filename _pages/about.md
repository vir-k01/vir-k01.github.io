I'm a senior year undergraduate in the Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Department at IIT Madras. On the work side of things, I'm presently an undergrad researcher at the [Materials Design Group](https://mme.iitm.ac.in/satyesh/) at IITM. I was a MITACS Gloablink Intern in the [Centre for Design of Advanced Materials](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jdhogan/index.html) at the University of Alberta, Edmonton over the summer of 2022, and prior to that, I was a [Young Research Fellow](https://yrf.iitm.ac.in/) with the Mechanics of Microstructures Group at MME, IIT Madras. My current research interests lie at the intersection of Deep Learning, Materials Modelling and Computational Materials Engineering, and I'm hoping to dive deeper into these fields when I get into grad school. You can find more about my work [here](https://vir-k01.github.io/research/) and a copy of my CV [here](https://vir-k01.github.io/files/CV_VirKaran_N2022.pdf). 

Outside of academics, I was one of the student heads of [Mind Trials](https://mindtrials.shaastra.org/), a new initiative as part of [Shaastra](https://shaastra.org/) which is the annual technical fest of IIT Madras, wherein the objective is to improve awareness of behavioural science amongst the masses and tackle a few pressing societal issues, such as road safety, sanitation habits and nutrition using the principles of behavioural design. In continuation of this inititave, I'm one of the founders of the Behavioural Insights Club at IIT Madras.  

In my spare time, I like to consume good "content" (if there is an acclaimed movie or tv series, there's a pretty good chance I'd have seen it). You can get a glimpse of what I'm watching [here](https://letterboxd.com/virk_01/)!
