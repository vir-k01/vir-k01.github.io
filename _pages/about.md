I'm a Junior year undergraduate in the Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Department at IIT Madras. On the work side of things, I'm presently a research intern at the Computational Materials Science Group at IIT Hyderabad and a [Young Research Fellow](https://yrf.iitm.ac.in/) with the Mechanics of Microstructures Group at IIT Madras. My research interests lie at the intersection of Deep Learning, Materials Modelling and Computational Materials Engineering. You can find more about my work [here](https://vir-k01.github.io/research/) and a copy of my CV [here](https://vir-k01.github.io/cv/). 

Outside of academics, I'm one of the student heads of [Mind Trials](https://mindtrials.shaastra.org/), a new initiative as part of [Shaastra](https://shaastra.org/) which is the annual technical fest of IIT Madras, wherein the objective is to improve awareness of behavioural science amongst the masses and tackle a few pressing societal issues, such as road safety, sanitation habits and nutrition using the principles of behavioural design. 

In my spare time, I like to consume good content (if there is an acclaimed movie or tv series, there's a pretty good chance I'd have seen it). You can get a glimpse of what I'm watching [here](https://vir-k01.github.io/media-archive/).
